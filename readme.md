### Readme

The only rule of the repo is don't push commits to master. Instead, feel free to add branches for things you are working on and push whatever you want to those. When you're done, open a pull request for your branch targeting master.

Github makes it easy to review and make suggestions to something someone is working on as they develop it, we should take advantage of this. For this reason, try not to self merge your PRs. 

As well, using PRs helps to structure development into natural pieces. Ideally, one fix/feature should map to one PR. As well, a PR will continue to update as you push commits to it's branch, so don't be afraid to open PRs for unfinished code, it allows people to see what you're doing and leave comments as you develop.
